# Using KNN regression to determine factors driving poor phsycial health
## Overview
This HTML file is a Jupyter Notebook regarding health data analysis. It presents an analytical workflow that combines data preparation, exploratory analysis, statistical evaluation, and interpretation to detect patterns and relationships within a health-related dataset.
While originally a college course assignment, it is designed to demonstrate applied data analysis techniques in a real-world health context.

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze health-related variables 
- Explore relationships between health indicators
- Identify patterns within the data
- Summarize statistical results

## Structure and Analytical Flow

### 1. Data Preparation/Wrangling
- 2019 Release of the 500 Cities Dataset imported as CSV File
- Data Cleaning, including handling missing values and formatting variables.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used a regression plot to determine if factors such as obesity and high cholesterol are strongly correlated
- Created a box plot to determine the average percentage of obese individuals
### 3. Statistical and Relationship analysis
- Used KNN Regression to determine which factors had the largest negative effect on individual physical health
- Factors included: obesity, cancer, COPD, mental health and health insurance
### 4. Visualizations
- Created histograms and confusion matrices
- Variables chosen determined to be good predictors of overall lack of physical health
- Confusion Matrix used to determine if the model could correctly predict if a city was located in California or Texas.
## Intended Use
This project demonstrates strong data analytics skills, including:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory and statistical analysis
- Visualization and interpretation
