# Health 2: Modeling Health Data with Decision Trees and Random Forest Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on health-related data analysis. It is designed to reinforce analytical reasoning while demonstrating applied data analysis techniques within a health context.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this report is to:
- Analyze relationships between multiple health variables
- Compare and contrast various outcomes across variables or groups
- Translate quantitative findings into data-driven decisions

## Structure and Analytical Flow
### 1. Data refinement and preparation
- Data Cleaning and Wrangling
- Creation of subsets
### 2. Exploratory and comparative analysis
- Assess similarities and differences across health metrics.
- Identify patterns within the data.
### 3. Visualization
- Decision trees to determine which factors negatively impact physical health 
- Histogram for the residuals to determine if the decision tree model had reliable results
- Random forest to create a prediction model that could conclude if a city was located in California or Texas based on various factors
- A Confusion Matrix to determine the accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity of the random forest model
- ROC Curve to determine the overall performance of the random forest model
### 4. Interpretation and insight
- Ran code to determine the importance of predictor variables

## Libraries Used
