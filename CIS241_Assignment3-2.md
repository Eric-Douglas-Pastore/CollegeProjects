# Airbnb Pricing and Bookability Analysis
## Purpose
The primary goal of the notebook is to analyze Airbnb dataset variables to better understand pricing behavior, listing characteristics, and market trends. The notebook blends narrative explanation with executable analysis to clearly communicate both the process and the results.
## Structure and Flow
The notebook follows a logical analytical progression:
### Data Wrangling
Before any deeper data analysis can be performed, the project filters, groups, and aggregates the dataset.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The goal of this project is to find which factors are able to cause an Airbnb to be instantly bookable.  Some predictor variables that were chosen include Airbnb price, availability, average review score, the total number of reviews, and accommodations.  These predictor variables allow the project to use summary statistics and tabular outputs to identify hidden distributions and trends.
### Analysis and Comparison
- Compares listing attributes across categories (e.g., room types or neighborhoods).
- Highlights differences that may influence pricing or availability.
### How do these results reflect real-world data?
Markdown cells explain what the results mean in practical terms, which allows connections with real-world Airbnb marketplace behavior to be found.
## Libraries used
- Pandas
- Altair

## Intended Use and interpretation of this project
This project is part of my academic journey at W&J College for data analysis. It demonstrates applied analytical thinking skills and is intended to be viewed by stakeholders who are interested in marketable insights concerning Airbnb prices.
## Key Takeaways
Overall, this project lists step-by-step data analysis on Airbnb prices that emphasizes exploratory analysis, structured reasoning, and clear communication of observations, making it easy to understand for people without a mathematical, statistical, and analytical mindset.
