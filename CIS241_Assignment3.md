# Airbnb Data Analysis – Jupyter Notebook Report
## Overview

This repository contains a zipped HTML report that aims to analyze Airbnb marketplace data. The notebook documents a complete analytical workflow that combines data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical evaluation, and interactive visualizations to derive insights into Airbnb listings and performance metrics.


## Analytical Focus
The analysis centers on Airbnb marketplace data, including:
- Listed Prices
- Availability metrics
- Reviews and ratings 
- Host and neighborhood attributes

The primary goal of this report is to understand factors that influence pricing, demand, and listing performance for airbnb locations.

## Key Analytical Components

1. Data Loading and Preparation
- Airbnb data imported from structured sources
- Data cleaning steps include Handling missing values, filtering invalid or extreme observations, formatting numeric and categorical variables, and high data quality before analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics are used to understand distributions, central tendencies, and variability
- The visualizations within the report identified price ranges, outliers, and common listing characteristics
- Potential relationships between variables flagged for deeper analysis

3. Correlation Analysis
- Correlation coefficients computed across multiple Airbnb features
- Quantified relationships between price, reviews, availability, and other listed attributes
- Results structured for visual comparison and interpretation

4. Visualization and Interactivity
- Interactive visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, histograms, and regression lines (primarily used to illustrate trends)
- Thoughtful color encoding and layout choices to improve interpretability


5. Comparative and Statistical Insights
- Side-by-side evaluation of multiple variables
- Identification of strong vs. weak predictors of price or demand, patterns across different listing characteristics, and findings contextualized within the Airbnb business model

6. Interpretation and Communication
- Each analytical step is supported by an explanatory narrative
- Visual results translated into actionable insights
- Balanced technical rigor with clear, accessible storytelling

## Intended Use
This project serves as a demonstration of strong analytical thinking skills, including:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Correlation and statistical analysis
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Communicating insights through narrative and visuals

## Technologies/Libraries Used
